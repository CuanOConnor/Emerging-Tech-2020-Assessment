# Emerging Technologies Assessment Submission
***

## Overview

This assessment contains a set of 4 tasks.

The tasks were all completed within a jupyter notebook.

The language used for the code aspect is python3.

Markdown cells explain the function of each tasks, which is in the notebook within the repository.

References for the tasks are listed at the bottom of each task.

***

### Task 1 - Square roots

The goal of this task was to find the square root of 2 using a function and display it to 100 Decimal places.

***

It was done using no external libraries.

### Task 2 - Chi-Squared

The goal of this task is to verify that a Chi Squared value (given) is correct using scipy.stats and to calculate the associated p value.

***

### Task 3 - STDDEV, and Population vs Sample Data

The goal of this task is to decide or prove that getting the Standard deviation on a sample sized data set is superior to performing it on a population sized set. 

Then i had to prove this using numpy to perform a simulation of this in action.

***

### Task 4 - Applying k-means clustering to Fisher’s Iris data set

The goal/objective of this task is to use scikit-learn to apply k-means clustering to Fisher’s Iris data set.

Then there is an explanation of how the code works in the markdown after the code.
